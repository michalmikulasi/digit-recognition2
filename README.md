# digit-recognition2
another approach to digit recognition problem. This approach is originally from a book from Michael Nielsen i was following,
so this idea is not mine even though i wrote it and modified it. 

We have loader.py and svm.py . We use loader to preprocess our data and support vector machine algorithm 
to create a model. It is good to see that not everything has to be done with neural networks, and it is good to see
that we are not forgetting about svm. svm can be very fast and accurate. This alternative solution is worth noting, 
even though i would prefer the other solution that i wrote.
